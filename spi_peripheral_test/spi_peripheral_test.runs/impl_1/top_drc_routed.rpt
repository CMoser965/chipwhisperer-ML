2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net DUT/MISO_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin DUT/MISO_i_2/O, cell DUT/MISO_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT DUT/MISO_i_2 is driving clock pin of 9 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
DUT/MISO_reg, DUT/command_reg[0], DUT/command_reg[1], DUT/command_reg[2],
DUT/command_reg[3], DUT/command_reg[4], DUT/command_reg[5],
DUT/command_reg[6], DUT/command_reg[7]
Related violations: <none>
